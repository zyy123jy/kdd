We can not distribute the data due to the restriction of ADNI http://adni-info.org/, however, one can register and download the data from: https://tadpole.grand-challenge.org/data/
After the data is downloaded, please construct a structure "dat" includes:
      age: [8718x1 double]
      APOE: [8718x1 double]
      date: {8718x1 cell}
     gender: {8718x1 cell}
     label: {8718x1 cell}
        id: [8718x1 double]
      MMSE: [8718x1 double]
      ADAS: [8718x1 double]
      cdrs: [8718x1 double]
       ven: [8718x1 double]
       hip: [8718x1 double]
     brain: [8718x1 double]
       edu: [8718x1 double]
The, we can convert the "dat" to our format using: convert_data.m.
Please note that in our model, Y1 represent MMSE, Y2 represent ADAS-COG, Y3 represent ventricle volume and Y4 represent hippocampus volume, Y5 present CDRSB.
